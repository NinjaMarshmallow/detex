The drawings show some data involving three variables: 
\begin{itemize}
\item D --- a quantitative variable
\item A --- a quantitative variable
\item G --- a categorical variable with two levels: S \& K
\end{itemize}

Sketch the graph on a piece of paper.  Over that sketch, draw a function
that shows the pattern of
the fitted model values for each of the following models:

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item \model{D}{A+G}

\begin{AnswerText}

There are two linear components --- one for each level of G.  But, since there is no interaction term, the lines must have the same slope. 
\end{AnswerText}

\item \model{D}{A-1}
\begin{AnswerText}

The exclusion of the intercept term forces the line to go through the origin.
\end{AnswerText}

\item \model{D}{A}
\begin{AnswerText}

A simple straight-line graph.
\end{AnswerText}

\item \model{D}{A*G}
\begin{AnswerText}
\includegraphics[width=1.5in]{../Figures/S2007-9-fig-ans2.png}

By including an interaction term between A and G, the lines for each group can have different slopes.
\end{AnswerText}

\item \model{D}{1}
\begin{AnswerText}
\includegraphics[width=1.5in]{../Figures/S2007-9-fig-ans4.png}

This is the all-cases-the-same model.  Since model doesn't depend on A or G at all, the graph is flat.
\end{AnswerText}

\item \model{D}{poly(A,2)}
\begin{AnswerText}
\includegraphics[width=1.5in]{../Figures/S2007-9-fig-ans6.png}

A second-order polynomial has a parabolic shape.  The fitted parameters set the location of the peak and the orientation (``bowl'' or ``mountain'').
\end{AnswerText}
\end{enumerate}
