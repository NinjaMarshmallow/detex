Here is a display constructed using the Current Population Survey wage data:

\centerline{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{../Figures/box-wages.png}}

Which of the following commands will make this? Each of the
possibilities is a working command, so try them out and see which one
makes the matching plot.  Before you start, make sure to read in the
data with 
\begin{verbatim}
> cps = fetchData("cps.csv")
\end{verbatim}

\begin{MultipleChoice}
\wrong{\code{bwplot( wage ~ sex, groups= sector, data=cps)}}
\correct{\code{bwplot( wage ~ sex | sector, data=cps)}}
\wrong{\code{bwplot( wage ~ cross(sex,sector), data=cps)}}
\end{MultipleChoice}
